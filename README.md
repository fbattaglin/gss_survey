## Part 1: Data

For more than four decades, the General Social Survey (GSS) has studied the growing complexity of American society. It is the only full-probability, personal-interview survey designed to monitor changes in both social characteristics and attitudes currently being conducted in the United States. 

### Metodology
The target population of the GSS is adults (18+) living in households in the United States. The GSS sample is drawn using an area probability design that randomly selects respondents in households across the United States to take part in the survey. Based on the nature and methodology of the survey, all relationships indicated may indication **association, but not causation**.

### Sampling
The GSS performs **random sampling**, so it tries to make a broad generalization of the US population. Respondents that become part of the GSS sample are from a mix of urban, suburban, and rural geographic areas. Participation in the study is voluntary.

The GSS is a **observational study**. It draws inferences from a sample to a population where the independent variable is not under the control of the researcher because of ethical concerns or logistical constraints.

### Possible Sources of Bias
- It was not until 2006 that Spanish-speaking adults were included in the survey.
- Interviews may genarate **Social desirability bias**. It is a type of response bias that influences a participant to deny undesirable traits, and ascribe to themselves traits that are socially desirable.
- **Demand characteristics** refer to a type of response bias where participants alter their response or behavior simply because they are part of an experiment.

## Part 2: Research question
For many years, the scientific community has been wondering — and often worrying — about the extent to which the public trusts science. Some observers have warned of a “war on science,” and recently some have expressed concern about the rise of populist antagonism to the influence of experts.  Apparently there is a feud between religious science-deniers and the scientific community. Some would say that science and religion are incompatible, and you must choose between them.

>Is there a association between religion and the level of confidence in the scientific community?

In order to address this question we will focus on the following variables:

+ **YEAR:** GSS YEAR FOR THIS RESPONDENT  
  Data type: numeric Record/columns: 1/7-10

+ **CONSCI:** CONFIDENCE IN SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY.  
  As far as the people running these institutions are concerned, would you say you have a great deal of confidence in Scientific community

+ **RELIG:**  RELIGIOUS PREFERENCE.  
  What is your religous preference? Is it Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, some other religion, or no religion?

+ **ATTEND:** HOW OFTEN R ATTENDS RELIGIOUS SERVICES.  
  How often do you attend religious services?
